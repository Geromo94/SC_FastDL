You are Corporal Daniel Shephard. After crash landing on your way to Black Mesa, your brother Adrian became a Corporal in less than 3 years. Very few people have ever become a officer that quickly. 
As a lowly grunt you have been given the perfect opportunity to prove yourself and show that Adrian isn't the only successful one in the family. Escape an infested research facility with aliens and a whole battalion of Black Ops... its going to be hell.
